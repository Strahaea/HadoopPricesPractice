# Hadoop Sales Data Practice
First part of the project in Lesson3 for Udacity/Cloudera's Intro to Hadoop/Mapreduce Course.
Uses python mappers and reducers on HDFS to analyze a large dataset (200MB) containing sales information for many  
branches of a chain retailer. 
Probes the dataset for information such as the particular item that had the most revenue, the stores and their total sales, 
the total number of sales, etc.

The initial project code (basically an example mapper and reducer) provided by Udacity/Cloudera can be found in the StoreTotalSales folder. This code found the total sales for each individual store. I then adapted this in the other folders to answer different questions about the data.

The dataset (prices.txt) used can be downloaded from the course materials section of Udacity's Intro to Hadoop and Mapreduce course.
